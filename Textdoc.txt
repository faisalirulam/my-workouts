Computer science is the study of computers and computing concepts.It includes both hardware and software as well as networking and the Internet.The hardware aspect of computer science overlaps with electrical engineering.
It covers the basic design of computers and the way they work.
A fundamental understanding of how a computer computes or performs calculations provides the 
foundation for comprehending more advanced concepts.
For example understanding how a computer operates in binary allows you to understand how 
computers add subtract and perform other operations.
Learning about logic gates enables you to make sense of processor architecture
The software side of computer science covers programming concepts as well as 
specific programming languages.
Programming concepts include functions algorithms and source code design.
Computer science also covers compilers operating systems and software applications.
User focused aspects of computer science include computer graphics and user interface design.
Since nearly all computers are now connected to the Internet the computer science umbrella covers.
Internet technologies as well, This includes Internet protocols telecommunications and networking concepts.It also involves practical applications such as web design and network administration.
